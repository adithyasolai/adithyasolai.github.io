Styling precedence:
In your style sheet/style element, the style class
that is written further down the page has more precendence
than the ones before it.

ID attributes and corresponding id classes have precedence over
normal class declarations. ID classes look like this:
#id_name {
    color: red;
}

Doing in-line styling has precendence over the two mentioned above.

Putting a "!important" in a class' declaration gives it more
precendece than anything.
Ex:
.red_text {
    color: red !important;
}
