<h> hi </h>

<!--
    <a> is an anchor element.
    Can put href inside the anchor element to go to links.
    Links can be external or internal.
    For external, just do href='url'
    Ex: <a href = 'url'> Write the hypertext here </a>
    Need to include 'https://' in the link, or it will
    try to go to a file in the website's current directory
    with the same name as the URL you put.

    For internal, put href = '#some id', and the user will
    jump to the element with the id='some id'. You can also
    add target = '_blank' to either of these to make the
    link open in a new page.

    <li>
        <a href = "https://google.com"
           target = "_blank">

    <li>
        <a href = "#bottom">
